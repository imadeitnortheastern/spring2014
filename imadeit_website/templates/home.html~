	<p>iMadeIT is a program that aims to teach members the basics (and some of the intermediates)

	and we have more pizza than Domino's.</p></li>
    <li><strong>When?</strong>
	<p>Thursdays from 7-9PM</p></li>
    <li><strong>Where?</strong>
	<p>102 West Village G</p></li>
    <li><strong>Can I Come?</strong>
	<p>Heck yes! iMadeIT is freely available to anyone who is even mildly interest in learning how to code. Come on down!</p></li>
</ul>
